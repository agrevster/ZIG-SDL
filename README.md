# SDL on Zig

This is a fork of [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/), packaged for Zig (Initially by Andrew Kelley) and in-sync with the latest SDL releases in the main repository.
Unnecessary files have been deleted, and the build system has been replaced with `build.zig

## Usage

We can easily fetch this library using `zig fetch`, for example:

```bash
zig fetch --save https://github.com/pwbh/SDL/archive/refs/tags/release-2.30.3.zip
```

If another SDL version needed, we can use a different tag instead of the `release-2.30.3` in the url we fetch.

In your `build.zig`:

```zig
  const exe = b.addExecutable(.{
        .name = "my-project",
        .root_source_file = b.path("src/main.zig"),
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    });

    if (target.result.os.tag == .linux) {
        // The SDL package doesn't work for Linux yet, so we rely on system
        // packages for now.
        exe.linkSystemLibrary("SDL2");
        exe.linkLibC();
    } else {
        const sdl_dep = b.dependency("SDL", .{
            .optimize = .ReleaseFast,
            .target = target,
        });
        exe.linkLibrary(sdl_dep.artifact("SDL2"));
    }
```
